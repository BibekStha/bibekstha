# Bibek Shrestha

Currently working as a **Web Developer** in an Engineering Company based in **Toronto**.

I manage/update few web applications (created some myself), create internal utility web applications, manage cloud servers, all on my own.

I'm currently learning more of NuxtJs/VueJs applying to some web applications.

I would love to collaborate on a project with MEVN tech stack but I'm open to hearing any proposal.

You can reach me at [bibekmanshrestha@gmail.com](mailto:bibekmanshrestha@gmail.com).

###### Fun Facts
- I come from an **Electrical Engineering** background with interest in solar technology.
- I love playing **Dota 2**.
